A seed project for OOPD Assignment 010 Task 3 - SOLID Principles

Single Responsiblity Principle
(Class only has one job to do/ serperate responsibilies)


Open Close Prinicple
(If it ain't broke, don't fix it)
New features should be implemented with new code, not changing the old code.
Use abstract and override.


Liskov's Substitution Principle
(Think ducks! Parent class is duck, if child class is mechanical duck then you're quacking at the wrong tree. Mechanic duck uses batteries. Need female ducks)

Intergration Segregation Principle
Fat code is no go, no client should be forced to use code it does not need, don't overload classes with a bunch of methods like I'm doing with already long sentence by putting in a lot of unnecessory jibber jabble and go make a sandwich. 

Dependency Inversion Principle 
It's really late. I should go to bed.
