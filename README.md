A seed project for OOPD Assignment 010 Task 3 - SOLID Principles

Single Responsiblity Principle<br>
(Class only has one job to do/ serperate responsibilies)<br>


Open Close Prinicple<br>
(If it ain't broke, don't fix it)<br>
New features should be implemented with new code, not changing the old code.<br>
Use abstract and override.<br>


Liskov's Substitution Principle<br>
(Think ducks! Parent class is duck, if child class is mechanical duck then you're quacking at the wrong tree. Mechanic duck uses batteries. Need female ducks)<br>

Intergration Segregation Principle<br>
Fat code is no go, no client should be forced to use code it does not need, don't overload classes with a bunch of methods like I'm doing with already long sentence by putting in a lot of unnecessory jibber jabble and go make a sandwich. <br>

Dependency Inversion Principle <br>
It's really late. I should go to bed.
